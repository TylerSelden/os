# Nightmare OS
**An appropriately named "operating system" that I was bored enough to make.**



## Capabilities
None. I can hardly get it to print to VGA text mode reliably.

## Bugs
Well...
* Strings over somewhere around ~60 characters in length just straight up won't print
* Probably many more that I haven't found yet
* The code is awful and I'm also really bad at C
